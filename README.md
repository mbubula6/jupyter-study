# Jupyter Study

## Main idea

Here I am to finally learn the all-mighty Jupyter and Machine Learning. Let's see how far I can go

## Project
It is predicting survival based on features: ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'sibsp', 'Parch', 'Fare'] from Titanic dataset. To predict I used RandomForest.


## Used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Sklearn.model_selection, ensemble, metrics

## Final
I tried creating easy model, then explored other possibilities in second notebook.

It was fun and educating, see you soon.
