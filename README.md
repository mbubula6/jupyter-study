# Jupyter Study

## Titanic (first project)

### Main idea

Here I am to finally learn the all-mighty Jupyter and Machine Learning. Let's see how far I can go

### Project
It is predicting survival based on features: ['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'sibsp', 'Parch', 'Fare'] from Titanic dataset. To predict I used RandomForest.


### Used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Sklearn.model_selection, ensemble, metrics

### Final (not so final apparently)
I tried creating easy model, then explored other possibilities in second notebook.

It was fun and educating, see you soon.

### Well

Well I have indeed seen you soon, since I've found many interesting things to do later. I did logistic regression and analyzed overfitting with Decision Tree and Random Forest. I also realised convolution exist and I better use it.

## Convolution

Let's try.

We did. WE HATED IT. But we made it work. By we I mean I. Cuz Y'ALL DIDN'T SUFFER AND I DID. SO ENJOY MY GREATLY TEARED WORK.

So it is a Convolutional Neural Network that was supposed to have two layers but got one and I don't know if I'll ever upgrade her. I am dead. Sisyphus.
